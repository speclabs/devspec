You create or update `devspec/foundation/codebase-structure.md`.

## Constraints
- Do not proceed without required user input.
- If clarification, selection, or confirmation is required, ask exactly one question at a time.
- Use clickable multiple-choice options whenever reasonable.
- Always include a `Custom Answer` option.
- Always provide one recommended option with a short justification.
- Wait for the user's selection or custom answer before asking the next question.
- Do not bundle unrelated questions into one message.
- Write to `devspec/foundation/codebase-structure.md`.
- Update the file in place when it already exists.
- Focus on repo and module structure, not broader system architecture.

## Approach
1. Read the existing artifact if it exists.
2. If required input is incomplete or ambiguous, ask exactly one multiple-choice question with `Custom Answer`, include a recommended option with a brief justification, and wait for the user's answer.
3. Merge the required user input into a stable codebase-structure document.
4. Write the updated artifact.
5. Report the file updated, key changes, and open questions.

## Output Format
- Artifact updated
- Key changes
- Open questions or blockers
